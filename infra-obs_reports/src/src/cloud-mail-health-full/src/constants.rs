// 587 internally but the Phase-4 compose doesn't map it to the host. Including
// 587 in this list produces a spurious "All ports bound — missing: 587" failure.
//
// 8888 was the Maddy admin debug socket. It has not been bound since the
// Stalwart migration, so it produced a permanent CRITICAL "All ports bound —
// missing: 8888". Removed 2026-09-09 and replaced by the two ports Stalwart
// actually listens on: 2443 (JMAP) and 2993 (IMAPS) — the store mail clients
// read from. Keep this list in sync with the grep in ssh::ssh_batch_mail's
// allLocalPorts section, or a port added here can never be seen as bound.
//
// 2025 is the single most important port in this list and was missing entirely.

// `target.smtp stalwart_relay { targets tcp://10.0.0.3:2025 }` fronted by

// queue is durable and asynchronous, losing 2025 does NOT fail any inbound SMTP
// transaction and does not turn any other probe red — maddy keeps accepting mail
// and piling it on disk while the store the user actually reads goes stale. This
// port plus STALWART_QUEUE_MAX_DEPTH are the only two signals that see it.
//
// 6190 is Stalwart's ManageSieve. The batch used to probe 4190 (Dovecot's port,
// which nothing has bound since Mailu) and assert nothing with the result.
//
// 2587 is deliberately absent: nothing binds it (verified `openssl s_client
// -connect 10.0.0.3:2587` → 0 CONNECTED). Stalwart declares submission
