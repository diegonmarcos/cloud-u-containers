// Tester: every file the Dockerfile COPYs must be staged by the flake.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — measured 2026-09-20, Ship run 35523940910:
//   #19 [runtime 8/18] COPY server.mjs mcp.mjs sessions-store.mjs http-post.mjs package.json /app/
//   ERROR: failed to calculate checksum ... "/http-post.mjs": not found
//
// http-post.mjs was added to src/code and hand-copied into dist/code/arm64, and
// it is committed there — so every local check said it was present. But the ship
// engine does not use the committed dist: it REGENERATES it ("Building nix flake
// -> dist/") from nativeBuild.extraFiles in src/flake.nix, and that list never
// gained the file. The flake output silently replaced the committed dist with
// one missing http-post.mjs, and the COPY failed as soon as that docker layer
// was not served from cache.
//
// The failure mode is what makes this worth a guard: it is INVISIBLE until a
// cache miss, so it can sit latent for days and then fail a deploy that has
// nothing to do with the file. And the green that followed was worse — the next
// Ship "succeeded" with Build and Deploy both SKIPPED, which reads exactly like
// a successful deploy.
//
