    # build-cloud-agi-goose.json, and a SYMLINK into cloud-infra's dist rather
    # than the 52,827-byte regular file that used to sit here. #542 renamed
    # containers.app.container_name to cloud-agi-goose, which moves this
    # generated file's NAME (the emitter writes `build-${containerName}.json`),
    # so the old name is gone from dist. claude-api failed loudly on that same
    # rename (run 35995862469); this service did NOT — because the copy here was
    # frozen, not linked, so it kept building from a pre-rename config with no
    # error at all. Measured staleness in that frozen copy: secret_env_vars was
    # missing GH_TOKEN, runtime.call_timeout_ms was 180000 not 860000,
    # runtime.claude_model and runtime.sessions.{name,resume} were absent
    # entirely, and .services still named four retired services
    # (c3-infra-mcp, c3-services-mcp, claude-superset-api, cloud-cgc-mcp) while
    # missing ten live ones.
    #
    # Switching to the link changes NOTHING the build actually consumes, which
    # is why it is safe to do here and was worth verifying rather than assuming:
    # compose.nix reads `buildJson.runtime` / `buildJson.containers.app` from
    # ../build.json, never this file, and _shared/engine.nix touches this file
    # only as `container.container.image` — a fallback for
    # buildJson.upstream_image, which is declared ("python:3.13-slim"), and the
    # two .container.image values are byte-identical anyway. The only field
    # whose VALUE moves is .container.container_name (my-ai-api →
    # cloud-agi-goose), read by nothing in this flake. What the link buys is
    # that the staleness above can never silently return.
