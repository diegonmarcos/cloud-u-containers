# start.sh — supervise the my-ai-api processes in one container:
#   1. compress_service  (Python/FastAPI · vendored Headroom)  — best-effort sidecar
#   2. goosed            (goose serve ACP agent, optional)     — best-effort sidecar
#   3. gateway.mjs       (Telegram + Mattermost → goose bridge, optional) — best-effort
#   4. server.mjs        (Node front · core HTTP API :3217)    — lifecycle process
#
# Slimmer than claude-superset-api's start.sh: NO headroom transparent-proxy face
# (no `headroom proxy --backend anthropic` — we route OpenRouter, and the Node
# front forwards directly), NO claude-config sync (the agent is goose, which
# runs on the client, not in this container). The Headroom compression hop
# (compress_service.py) is kept — that is the tokens-optimization plugin.
#
# tini (compose init:true) is PID1 and reaps short-lived fetch children. This
# script execs server.mjs as the final foreground process: the container lives
# and dies only with the core API on :3217. The three sidecars are best-effort
# background jobs — their failure is logged but never takes the container down.

# function. Backs off on a rapid crash-loop (2s..30s) so a genuinely broken
# binary cannot spin CPU, but never gives up: the container's lifecycle process

# on purpose: baking it would retype the store's path into a source file, and
# a second copy of that path is exactly how cloud-agi-claude ended up with
# AGENT_MEMORY_DIR while goose and hermes had nothing. The text comes from
# AGENT_MEMORY_BRIEFING, which _shared/engine.nix derives from the same
# binding as the git-tree mount the store lives under.
#
# Absence is LOUD, as in claude's hook: a hints file that silently does not
# exist is indistinguishable from an agent whose memory happens to be empty,
# and the agent then answers from the conversation as though it had recall.
