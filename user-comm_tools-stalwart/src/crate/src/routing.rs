//! Re-apply the routing rules to ALL mail, not just mail being delivered.
//!
//! The native Sieve owns routing at delivery. That is correct and stays. But
//! sieve fires exactly once per message and never again, so:
//!
//!   * fixing a rule leaves every already-delivered message misfiled forever;
//!   * adding a rule leaves the new folder holding only future mail.
//!
//! Both bit us on 2026-08-29: `route.junk.spam_flagged` sat at priority 30 and
//! swallowed wg-gesucht mail before the housing rule at 100 could see it, so
//! `24 House` held 1 message while the sorter-maintained `Fi` view — same
//! account, same mail, same predicate — held all 370. The difference was never
//! the rule. It was that views get re-evaluated and routing did not.
//!
//! So routing gets the same treatment the views already get: every poll, over
//! every message in the source scope, add AND remove membership. Two things
//! differ from `filters.rs`, both because routing is a partition and views are
//! not: the rule list is ORDERED (first match wins, mirroring sieve's `stop;`)
//! and the outcome is EXCLUSIVE (exactly one routing folder, never two).
//!
//! ponytail: no separate backfill command. A one-shot "apply to all" is a
//! second code path that drifts from the live one and gets run by hand at 3am;
//! making the steady-state loop idempotent over all mail means the backfill IS
//! the normal poll, and the first poll after a rule change fixes history for
//! free.
