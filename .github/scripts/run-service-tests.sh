# cloud-u-containers per-service tester runner (ticket #486)
#
# Reads the `tests` key of every build.json in this repo and runs each tester it
# declares. The `tests` key (registered by #476, now validated by
# build.schema.json) maps a tester name to a run spec:
#
#     "tests": {
#       "<name>": { "cmd": "<shell command>", "cwd": "<dir, optional>" }
#     }
#
# `cwd` is relative to the directory that CONTAINS the build.json (e.g. "src"
# for a tester living under <svc>/src). When omitted, the tester runs from the
# build.json's own directory.
#
# Discovery: every REAL build.json under this repo. Each service has a real
# <category>_<repo>/<svc>/build.json and a `src/build.json` that is a SYMLINK to
# it, so `find -type f` visits every service exactly once — the src symlink is
# naturally skipped and no tester is double-counted.
#
# THE ONE RULE THIS RUNNER EXISTS TO ENFORCE (ticket #486): a run that executed
# ZERO testers must NOT look like a run where everything passed. So it always
# prints how many testers it DISCOVERED and how many it EXECUTED, and it FAILS
# hard in either of two cases:
#
#   1. it discovers no testers at all  -> a broken discovery step / empty
#      registry, never a clean repo. Today the true answer is 1 (the #476
#      drift-multi-container tester), so a 0 means the globbing is wrong.
#   2. it discovers testers but executes none -> a wiring bug.
#
# Any individual tester that exits non-zero also fails the run.
