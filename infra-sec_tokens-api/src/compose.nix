# compose.nix — tokens-api, the fleet token engine.
#   - Own code (Type A), packaged by the ship engine (native_build.type=image-wrapper).
#   - Host network on oci-apps, bound to the host's WireGuard IP (wg-only policy): the
#     hub Caddy and introspect-proxy on gcp-proxy reach it over the mesh.
#   - ONE gunicorn worker: the store is one sqlite file guarded by an in-process lock.
#   - Secrets (sops, src/secrets.yaml -> .secrets via env_file): TOKENS_FLEET_KEY (encrypts the
#     stored token values) and TOKENS_VERIFY_SECRET (shared with introspect-proxy).
