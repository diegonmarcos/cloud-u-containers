  # ── Memory budget, declared in build.json, never written here ────────
  # build.json containers.app.resources carries every number; no size literal
  # is written in this file. Two halves, and neither works alone:
  #
  #   cgroup ceiling  mem_limit            -> deploy.resources.limits.memory
  #   engine budget   rocksdb_block_cache  -> SURREAL_ROCKSDB_BLOCK_CACHE_SIZE
  #                   rocksdb_write_buffer -> SURREAL_ROCKSDB_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE
  #
  # Without the ceiling, SurrealDB sizes its LRU block cache from the memory it
  # can see, which with no cgroup is the whole host:
  #   ROCKSDB_BLOCK_CACHE_SIZE default = max(visible/2 - 1GiB, 16MiB)
  #   (surrealdb v2.3.7, crates/core/src/kvs/rocksdb/cnf.rs:125-143)
  # On oci-apps that is 23.41GiB/2 - 1GiB ≈ 10.7GB — which is, to within
  # rounding, the 10.6GB a restart returned on 2026-09-21.
  #
  # Without the engine budget, the ceiling alone would just turn an unbounded
  # cache into a cgroup OOM kill: the cache is cgroup-aware, but it aims at
  # half the cap and floors at 16MiB, and the memtables (WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE ×
  # MAX_WRITE_BUFFER_NUMBER, default up to 128MiB × 32 = 4GiB) are sized off
  # host RAM tiers independently. So both are declared, explicitly.
  #
  # The cache is declared separately from the ceiling (2026-10-10) so the
  # ceiling can grow for ingest headroom without the cache growing with it: a
  # full graph refresh peaked at ~945MiB of the old 1G cap, so mem_limit went
  # to 2G while the cache stayed at 512M. Bounds enforced below, at render
  # time: cache <= 1/2 of the cap, and cache + memtables < the cap.
