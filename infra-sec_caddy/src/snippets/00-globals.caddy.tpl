  # ACME via DNS-01 (Cloudflare) — eliminates port-80 HTTP-01 dependency
  # and supports wildcard certs for *.diegonmarcos.com. Token sourced
  # from .secrets (env_file in compose.nix). Phase 2a of public-surface
  # collapse plan (a0_tasks/TASK-net-20260508-01_collapse-public-to-443.md).
  # resolvers 1.1.1.1: same fix caddy-public got on 2026-06-23, ported here.
  # This host's resolver is Hickory (10.0.0.1), which answers
  # *.diegonmarcos.com → 10.0.0.1 and has NO view of the Cloudflare
  # _acme-challenge TXT. Without it certmagic writes the TXT fine, then polls
  # Hickory, never sees it, and issuance times out ("waiting for record to
  # fully propagate"). caddy-public was patched then; gcp-proxy was not, so
  # every vhost here without a per-site tls{} override never got a cert --
  # mcp.diegonmarcos.com among them, which aborted TLS handshakes with an
  # internal_error alert because Caddy had no certificate to present for that
  # SNI. Only mta-sts and the *.diegonmarcos.com catch-all carried per-site
  # overrides; fixing it globally makes those redundant rather than load-bearing.
  # These are the mta-sts / catch-all per-site values promoted to the default,
  # not a weaker global. Those two blocks are the ONLY vhosts here that kept
  # their certs through the outage, so their settings are the ones with
  # evidence behind them: a second resolver in case 1.1.1.1 is unreachable,
  # and explicit propagation timing so the first poll does not race the TXT
  # write it is polling for. Every vhost now inherits that by default; the
  # per-site tls{} blocks in 90-mta-sts and 99-catch-all become redundant
  # rather than load-bearing, and are left in place only so this change does
  # not touch the two hosts that were already working.
