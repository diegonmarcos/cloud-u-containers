// claude-resume.mjs — the ONE place the claude backend turns a *resolved*
// session into `claude -p --resume <session> --cwd <dir>` spawn arguments, and
// the ONE place that answers "is the mounted task store reachable?".
//
// Ticket #548: the claude backend returned "0 tasks" because a fresh `claude
// -p` spawn lands in a brand-new session uuid whose `~/.claude/tasks/<uuid>/`
// directory is empty — Claude keeps the *task store* (keyed by session uuid) in
// a separate tree from the transcript store (`~/.claude/projects/...`), and the
// teleport shipped only the transcript half. The bot therefore asked a session
// that had no task files, and Claude's TaskList legitimately returned zero.
//
// The fix has two halves and BOTH are declared here, not scattered:
//
//  1. SPAWN: when a caller supplies a resolved session id + its project cwd
//     (already resolved by name upstream — see #525's resolveResumeAddress in
//     the goose gateway's sessions-store.mjs), pass `--resume <id>` AND spawn
//     with `--cwd` set to the session's project slug. Claude then lands in the
//     session whose task directory was just mounted, so TaskList reads the
//     real files instead of an empty fresh dir.
//
//     This module does NOT resolve names to ids. Resolution is #525's job and
//     lives in ONE place (sessions-store.mjs). A caller that hands this module
//     a raw uuid it guessed instead of a session the resolver returned is a
//     bug upstream, and this module refuses to be a second resolver — it only
//     trusts ids that resolve against the mounted store.
//
//  2. ABSENCE-IS-LOUD: "the store is unreachable" must never render as a
//     number. If a resume was requested but the mounted task store for that
//     session cannot be read, callers get an EXPLICIT error object. A bot
//     that relays "0" when the real answer is unknowable is the exact failure
//     family #400/#509/#548 is about.
//
// Pure / side-effect-free: import this from server.mjs and from tests.

// #525's resolver (goose gateway, sessions-store.mjs) turns a NAME into a
// session id. This module RECEIVES the resolved id — it never resolves a name
// itself (that would be the second resolver the ticket forbids). It accepts a
// value ONLY if it is an already-resolved session id (or absent). A caller that
// hands it a name ("cloud-mail") or a guessed literal uuid instead of the
// resolver's answer is rejected, so the spawn can never land in a session the
// store did not declare. This is what keeps the "pasted vs resolved" contract
// testable in isolation.

// A session's SERVED name (deriveSessionName) is a display label built from the
// newest `last-prompt` record, and Claude Code appends one every single turn.
// Declaring that label as the resume address therefore declares something that
// changes on every message: measured 2026-09-20, the orchestrator session's
// served name had become the literal word "go" while build.json still carried a
// days-old prompt tag, so every request missed and the bot answered with an
// error instead of the task count. Re-snapshotting the name fixes it until the
// next message — the address itself has to stop being mutable content.
//
// What IS stable about the target is what the bot is FOR: it is the session
// that owns the task store. So the address is derived at request time — among
// the sessions whose transcript lives under the declared project cwd, the one
// holding the most task files. Same fullest-store heuristic the backlog display
// uses (canonicalSessionDir in cloud-data-my-ai-memory/1.1.Product-Backlog), and
// it self-corrects when the orchestrator session rotates instead of going stale.

// Claude slugs a cwd into its transcript directory name by replacing every
// non-alphanumeric character with "-":
//   /home/appuser/git/_work/orchestrator → -home-appuser-git--work-orchestrator

// "-"), so the declared cwd is slugged to find the dir, never the other way.
