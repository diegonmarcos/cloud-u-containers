// Tester: ticket #556 — the agents actually have the memory system.
//
// THE DEFECT: a-context-inject-memory.sh has been called "inject-memory" since
// it was written and injected NO memory — only the principles checklist. A real
// store was mounted the whole time in the shared tree (a 72-line MEMORY.md index
// over ~169 entries under memory-entries/{feedback,project,reference}). Every
// agent that ever ran on oci-apps started with zero recall, and nothing said so,
// because the hook's own NAME made it look handled. That is the worst version of
// this failure: not a broken feature, an absent one wearing the label of a
// present one.
//
// Two properties this pins, and they pull against each other:
//   INDEX ONLY — entries are read on demand. A layout where the entry directory
//   auto-loads has already turned a 4.5k-token preload into 87k once; injecting
//   the entries here would repeat it on every agent session.
//   ABSENCE IS LOUD — a hook that silently emits nothing is indistinguishable
//   from one whose memory is merely empty. The agent must be TOLD it has no
//   recall, or it will answer from the conversation as though it did.
//
// SCOPE (narrowed by the second half of #556). The DECLARATION and the WIRING
// used to be checked here, against this container's own build.json
// runtime.memory and compose.nix. Both moved: the memory system is declared
// once in _shared/agent-memory.nix and published by engine.nix to EVERY
// container with agent.git_tree, because while it lived here it reached claude
// and NOT goose or hermes (measured 2026-09-24 inside the running containers:
// only cloud-agi-claude had AGENT_MEMORY_*). Those checks, plus the per-runtime
// consumption paths, now live in _shared/test-agent-memory-one-declaration.mjs,
// which EVALUATES the declaration and mutation-proves it.
//
// What stays here is the part that is genuinely claude's: the SessionStart hook
// is the only one of the three surfaces that injects the index ITSELF, so it is
// the only one that can bulk-read the entry tree by accident.
//
// Usage: node test-agent-memory-system.mjs   (cwd = <repo>/user-ai_my-ai_claude-api/src/code)
