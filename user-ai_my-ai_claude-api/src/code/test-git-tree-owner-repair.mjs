// Tester: ticket #558 — the shared tree repairs its own ownership, declaratively.
//
// The tree has ONE owner, 10001. When anything writes into it as another uid,
// every agent silently loses the tree: git dies with "detected dubious
// ownership" or "insufficient permission for adding an object" deep inside a
// subprocess, and the turn still reports success. Measured 2026-09-20: 260
// root-owned paths across four repos.
//
// The writer was gitea (a read-write mount it never used, running as root);
// that mount is gone. This asserts the OTHER half: the repair is part of the
// declaration, so it runs on every deploy and no one has to shell into the box.
// An ssh one-off would fix today and nothing else — and it cannot be the answer
// anyway, because a phone with a dead tunnel cannot reach the host.
//
// Agents cannot repair this themselves: they run as 10001 and chown on a
// root-owned path is EPERM. That is why the repair must be a separate service
// running as root, not a line in an agent's start.sh.
//
// Usage: node test-git-tree-owner-repair.mjs   (cwd = <repo>/user-ai_my-ai_claude-api/src/code)
