# Guard: every phone cloud-superapp-mcp dials is declared ONCE (build.json
# ssh.phones) and every consumer matches its phone entry.
#
# History: SUPERAPP_HOSTS once named aliases no config defined ("Could not
# resolve hostname" looked like a dead phone); later the MCP knew one phone
# (wg client `termux`, 10.0.0.9) while a second phone (samsung-a37,
# 10.0.0.10) joined the mesh, so every tool dialled the offline one.
#   - ssh.extra_hosts must be EXACTLY phones x doors x {v4,v6}, each row
#     carrying its phone's wg_client (the derive resolves the address from
#     cloud-infra config.json native.wireguard.clients; never restated here);
#   - compose.nix SUPERAPP_PHONES and device.ts's default must name declared aliases;
#   - device.ts's id map must send each phones[].id to that phone's alias.
