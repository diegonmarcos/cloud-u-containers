 * What an app module is, and how they are found.

 * twenty processes, and why the tool list must not be generated from the
 * devices at connect time.
 *
 * Adding an app: drop a folder under mcps-apps/<id>/ with an index.ts that
 * default-exports an AppModule. Nothing else changes — [loadModules] reads the
 * directory, so there is no barrel file to forget to update.
