# edge-auth.nix — the ONE shared public-edge auth gate, rendered into BOTH
# Caddyfiles (hub: infra-sec_caddy, edge: infra-sec_caddy-public).
#
# Policy (owner, 2026-10-16) lives in build.json caddy_config.edge_auth and is
# carried by the derive into build-caddy.json / build-caddy-edge.json:
#   a) private          — mesh only (wg_only / *.app): 403 to every non-mesh source
#   b) public-protected — DEFAULT for anything public: `import edge_auth`
#   c) public-open      — ONLY hosts listed in edge_auth.public_open (each with a reason)
# The CI guard (cloud-infra 9_others/test/edge-auth-gate.test.sh) renders both
# Caddyfiles' dist and fails on a site that is in no tier or in two.
#
# Two flavours of the same snippet:
#   edge_auth          — enforced for every source           (public hosts)
#   edge_auth_offmesh  — enforced only for NON-mesh sources  (hosts whose mesh
#                        clients are already trusted by the WG gate: mcp.,
#                        and wg_only vhosts that deliberately expose a few paths
#                        off-mesh, e.g. JMAP discovery)

  #   - `Authorization: Bearer ...` -> introspect-proxy (the same door the MCP routes
  #     use); an invalid token gets the introspector's own 401/403.
  #   - `X-Fleet-Authorization: Bearer ...` -> the same introspect-proxy (the token is
  #     moved into Authorization on the sub-request only); it wins over Authorization
  #     and is stripped before proxying, so a mailbox credential in `Authorization`
  #     (Stalwart Basic/Bearer on jmap./mails.) reaches the upstream untouched.
  #   - anything else -> Authelia forward-auth: a valid session cookie passes;
  #     otherwise Authelia answers 401 to API / non-browser clients and 302 to
  #     auth. (with rd=) to browsers. Nothing reaches an upstream anonymously.
  #   - Tier c (public_open in build.json caddy_config.edge_auth) is exempted by

  #     /.well-known/acme-challenge/* plus that host's own declared paths.

  #     credentials: it is answered 204 right here and never proxied. Plain
  #     OPTIONS (WebDAV) is still gated.
  # forward_auth sorts before handle / respond / reverse_proxy, so importing this
  # at the top of a site gates every handle in it. `redir` sorts BEFORE
