# memory-ceiling.nix — no container may render UNCAPPED.
#
# THE DEFECT. kg-store and kg-store-pub declared no memory limit, so
# `docker stats` showed them against the HOST total ("6.066GiB / 23.41GiB")
# — the tell that no cgroup limit exists at all. SurrealDB's RocksDB backend
# sizes its LRU block cache from the memory it can SEE:
#
#   ROCKSDB_BLOCK_CACHE_SIZE default = max(visible_memory / 2 - 1GiB, 16MiB)
#   (surrealdb v2.3.7, crates/core/src/kvs/rocksdb/cnf.rs:125-143)
#
# With no cgroup, "visible" is the whole box: 23.41GiB / 2 - 1GiB ≈ 10.7GB of
# cache the engine is entitled to hold and never returns. Measured on oci-apps
# 2026-09-21: restarting the two containers took available RAM from 1,303MB to
# 11,855MB — ~10.6GB, the predicted number. The leak was a CORRECTLY SIZED
# cache against the wrong denominator.
#
# WHY IT WAS SILENT. A service that declares nothing got no limit, and nothing
# anywhere said so. That is the property removed here: uncapped is no longer a
# reachable state. Every service either declares its own ceiling, or inherits
# the one declared for its category in _shared/compose-defaults.json, or the
# BUILD FAILS. There is no fourth outcome.
#
# WHY CATEGORY. build.json already classifies every service (the same field
# the directory prefix encodes), and build.schema.json already enumerates the
# values. Deriving the default from it adds no new concept to keep in sync — a
# parallel "tier"/"class" field would be a second classification that could
# disagree with the first.
#
# PURE ON PURPOSE — builtins only, no pkgs, no lib. engine.nix cannot be
# evaluated without a full nixpkgs; this file can, with a bare
# `nix-instantiate --eval`, which is what lets _shared/test-kg-store-memory-
# ceiling.mjs exercise the THROW instead of merely grepping for it. A guard
# nothing can execute is the "green that verified nothing" shape.
