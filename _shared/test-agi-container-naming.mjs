// Tester: #505/#542 — the AGI containers carry one name pattern, cloud-agi-*.
//
// Diego named the pattern himself in #542 ("Execute the cloud-agi-* container
// split"), so it is a declared convention, not an inferred one.
//
// SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. Measured 2026-09-20: 57 of the fleet's
// containers do not start with "cloud-", and most of them SHOULD NOT — gitea,
// redis and languagetool are upstream products whose own names are the correct
// ones. #351 ("one app-naming pattern cloud-{name}") is about the Constellation
// ANDROID APPS and was completed there; carrying it to every container would be
// a rule nobody wrote, mechanically applied to 57 services. This guard covers
// exactly the four AGI runtimes and nothing else.
//
// What it protects: before today one container was the goose runtime AND the
// gateway for both Telegram bots, and `docker ps` gave no way to tell what
// anything was. The names are now the documentation.
//
// Usage: node test-agi-container-naming.mjs   (cwd = <repo>/_shared)
