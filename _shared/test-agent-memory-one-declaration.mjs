// Tester: ticket #556 — EVERY oci-apps agent has the memory system, and the
// layout that made it affordable cannot be undone.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS PINS. #556's first pass wired the memory store into the
// claude container by declaring `runtime.memory` in my-ai_claude-api's OWN
// build.json. Measured inside the running containers 2026-09-24:
//
//   cloud-agi-claude   AGENT_MEMORY_DIR=/home/appuser/git/cloud-data-my-ai-memory/b_projects/home-diego
//   my-ai-api (goose)  AGENT_GIT_TREE only — no AGENT_MEMORY_* at all
//   hermes-agent       AGENT_GIT_TREE only — no AGENT_MEMORY_* at all
//
// Two of the three agents still ran with zero recall behind a ticket that read
// as done. That is the per-container-declaration-of-a-fleet-wide-fact shape
// #561 removed from `agent.git_tree_mount`, returning through a different door.
//
// WHY THIS EVALUATES INSTEAD OF GREPPING. Every value here is DERIVED: the
// store's absolute path from the git-tree mount, the briefing text from the
// path, the per-runtime env alias from build.json. Grepping for the strings
// would pass just as happily if agent-memory.nix hardcoded the path and ignored
// the mount — the "green that verified nothing" shape this fleet keeps
// producing. So _shared/agent-memory.nix is EVALUATED (builtins only, no pkgs,
// no lib, same as memory-ceiling.nix), and the load-bearing assertions
// re-evaluate it MUTATED to prove the outputs follow their inputs.
//
// THE OTHER HALF — the layout. Claude Code auto-loads the index PLUS every .md
// under a SUBDIRECTORY of the index's directory. A reorg into memory/<type>/
// turned 129 entries into auto-loaded imports and took session preload from
// ~4.5k to ~87k tokens (350,661 chars). So the briefing must forbid both the
// subdirectory and the bulk read, in words, because the agent is the thing that
// would recreate it.
//
